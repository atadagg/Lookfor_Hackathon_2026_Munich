I have been using NATPAT for several years without any issues, but the MagicPatch Itch Relief Patches I received seem to be the old version and the packaging is different than what is advertised on the website. The ones I received state that there are 27 patches, while the website states there are 32 patches in each pack. The most glaring issue is the performance and staying power of the patches I received. They fall off almost immediately and are guaranteed gone after sleeping. Overall, I'm displeased with the patches I received and I would like to get them replaced with the new version that are advertised on the website.\""
